<h1>Running Skin Cancer Classification Project in Jupyter Notebook</h1>
<h2>Steps to Follow:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install it using Anaconda distribution or directly with pip.</li>
  <li>Download the project folder, which includes the Python code file and the necessary dataset folders and files.</li>
  <li>Launch Visual Studio Code and open the .ipynb file included in the project.</li>
  <li>Ensure that all the necessary libraries are installed. You can install any missing libraries by running the command <code>!pip install library_name</code> in a notebook cell.</li>
  <li>Adjust the file paths in the code to match the locations of the dataset folders and files on your system. Make sure to update the paths in the <code>common_nevus</code>, <code>a_type</code>, <code>melanoma</code>, <code>common_nevus_color</code>, <code>a_type_color</code>, and <code>melanoma_color</code> dictionaries.</li>
  <li>Run the code by clicking on the "Run" button or by pressing Shift+Enter while the cell is selected. This will execute the code and display the output in the notebook.</li>
  <li>The code will generate various visualizations, including box plots and accuracy values, to analyze the skin cancer classification results based on different criteria such as diameter, symmetry, irregularity, and color variance.</li>
  <li>Review the output in the notebook to see the accuracy results for each category (Common Nevus, A-Type Nevus, and Melanoma) and the overall mean accuracy.</li>
  <li>You can further modify the code or add additional analysis as needed.</li>
  <li>Save the notebook if you want to keep the results for future reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you will be able to run the skin cancer classification project in Jupyter Notebook and analyze the results based on the provided dataset.</p>
